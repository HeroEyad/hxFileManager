    "releasenote": "Added a thread pool so it doesn't have to create threads every time you call an async function. Added more functions like copyFolderRecursive, deleteFolder, getFolderSize, and generateUniqueFileName. Also added admin check to detect if the program is running as admin, and a function to request admin privileges on Windows. New functions: copyFolderRecursive, deleteFolder, getFolderSize, getFileSize, generateUniqueFileName, isAdmin, requestAdmin.",
